        <h3>Feeding</h3>
        <p>
          Cats require taurine, an essential amino acid, for heart and eye
          health. You will need to provide fresh, clean water at all times, and
          wash and refill your catâ€™s water bowls daily. Treats should be no more
          than 5-10% of the diet. Take your pet to your veterinarian if signs of
          anorexia, diarrhea, vomiting or lethargy continue for more than two
          days.
        </p>
        <h3>Litter Box</h3>
        <p>
          DAll indoor cats need a litter box, which should be placed in a quiet,
          accessible location. In a multi-level home, one box per floor is
          recommended. Avoid moving the box unless absolutely necessary, but if
          you must do so, move the box just a few inches per day.
        </p>
        <h3>Medicines and Poisons</h3>
        <p>
          Never give your cat medication that has not been prescribed by a
          veterinarian. If you suspect that your animal has ingested a poisonous
          substance, call your veterinarian.
